I’m @DigitallyGray
Call me Digi.

I'm interesting in software and game development. I like problem solving. 
I've been programming for about 1 year.

I have 3, arguably 2, finished projects under my belt.

The first was one in Python, simple Todo List generator (What I learnt here hard carried me in uni the). It could:
- Create new todo list
- Delete todo list
- Add thing to todo list
- Remove thing from todo list
- Swap two things from todo list

The second was my first uni project, simple library system in java. Not going to explain this one.

The other one (not calling it my third) was a mess straight from hell, not talking about it. (It used javascript.)

Intrested in UX and UI design, I find those fun challenges.
I also make music, mostly for fun, don't think I'm good.

He/Him | Got the tism.

I use Generative AI for debugging and asking general questions.
I would never ask it to generate the logic to my code, you have to be genuinely be moronic to even remotely think thats a good idea.
No, my broken mess logic is all, unfortunately, authentically me... unfortunately.
