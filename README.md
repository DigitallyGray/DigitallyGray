# Information and Stuff

I’m @DigitallyGray or just DigitallyGray.

Call me Gray, Digital, Tally (if youre weird), or preferably Digi.

I've been programming for about 1 year.

## Boring Stuff

He/Him | Yes, I am autistic.
Main PC runs windows 11 (Disgusting I know)
Laptop runs Arch (btw. Uses GNOME, but one day I'll rice Hyprland... probably.)

## Intrests & Hobbies

I'm interested in software and game development. I like problem solving. 

Im also intrested in UX and UI design. 
I find those fun challenges, because you have to create an appealing design, and then put yourself in the users shoes.

I also make music, mostly for fun, I don't think any of it is good.

## Projects

```Python
# Python
N: Int = 2
print(f"I have {N} finished project under my belt.")
```

#### The first notable one was in Python, simple Todo List CLI program. It can:
- Create new todo list
- Delete todo list
- Add thing to todo list
- Remove thing from todo list
- Swap two things from todo list

This was my first project project taught me a lot, though it still is a bit of a mess, I didn't even know of proper naming conevntions back then either.
Might revisit for to allow for checking things off, and adding UI to it.

#### The second notable one was in Java, simple library CLI & GUI program.
I'll not really explain this one as I dont really care for it. But it has two versions:
- CLI Version
- GUI Version (Basically the CLI version but with colours and images)

Taught me about OOP. It was only a university project, I'm not revisiting it.

There was also the... group project. Not complete. It was a web project, it was also my *first* **ever** ***group project***. 
It used:
- That web develeopment language which I shall not name, you know the one. (Was learning it through the group project, like seriously why tf is `===` valid syntax?)
- Databases/SQL (Was learning it through the group project, why does SQL yell so much?)

And yes, it was just as much of a dumpster fire as you are currently imagining. 
(We submited the assignment at 11:58am with a week extention, the deadline with that week extention was at 11:59am)

## AI Disclaimer:

I use Generative AI for asking general questions and debugging.
I would never ask it to generate the logic for my code, as you would have to be genuinely be moronic to even remotely think thats a good idea.
So no, AI doesn't generate code for me. And yes, my broken mess logic is all, unfortunately, authentically me... unfortunately.
