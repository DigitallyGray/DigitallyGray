# Information and Stuff

I’m @DigitallyGray or just DigitallyGray.

Call me Gray, Digital, Tally (if youre weird), or preferably Digi.

I've been programming for about 1 year.

## Boring Stuff

He/Him | Got the tism.

## Intrests & Hobbies

I'm interested in software and game development. I like problem solving. 

Im also intrested in UX and UI design. 
I find those fun challenges, because you have to create an appealing design, and then put yourself in the users shoes.

I also make music, mostly for fun, I don't think any of it is good.

## Projects

I have 1 finished project under my belt.

#### The first one was in Python, simple Todo List generator. It can:
- Create new todo list
- Delete todo list
- Add thing to todo list
- Remove thing from todo list
- Swap two things from todo list
This project taught me a lot, though it still is a bit of a mess, I didn't even know of proper naming conevntions back then either.
Might revisit for renaming everything within it, and adding UI to it.

## AI Disclaimer:

I use Generative AI for asking general questions and debugging.
I would never ask it to generate the logic for my code, you would have to be genuinely be moronic to even remotely think thats a good idea.
So no, AI doesn't generate code for me. Yes, my broken mess logic is all, unfortunately, authentically me... unfortunately.
